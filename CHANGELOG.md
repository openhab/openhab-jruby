## [5.0.0](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-jruby/compare/4.45.2...v5.0.0)

5.0 is the first release as the officially supported gem of the openHAB organization.
Many thanks to [@boc-tothefuture](https://github.com/boc-tothefuture), [@ccutrer](https://github.com/ccutrer), [@jimtng](https://github.com/jimtng), and [@pacive](https://github.com/pacive) for their work on the previous versions.
This major release contains significant restructuring by [@ccutrer](https://github.com/ccutrer), with additional contributions by [@jimtng](https://github.com/jimtng).
Here is a non-exhaustive list of significant departures from the original gem:

- Logging has been reworked. There's generally no need to
  `include OpenHAB::Log` in your classes. {OpenHAB::Log.logger} method now
  accepts a String to explicitly find whichever logger you would like, and
  {OpenHAB::Logger#level=} can be used to dynamically change the log level.
  Issues around the logger name while a rule is executing have also been
  resolved: the top-level `logger` will be named after the file, and the
  `logger` within a `rule` or execution block will be named after the rule.
  Loggers within class or instance-of-a-class context will be named after
  the class. These loggers will _not_ have their name changed simply because
  their methods happened to be called while a rule is executing. Logging
  also defaults to `#to_s` now, instead of `#inspect`.
- The documentation philosophy has changed. Instead of relying on a large
  set of markdown files to give both commentary and to document the details
  of objects, [YARD](https://yardoc.org/) is now the primary generator
  of the documentation site. Details of individual objects and methods are
  now documented inline with the code, reducing duplication, aiding in
  keeping them up-to-date and accurate, and being more rigorous in ensuring
  the documentation has every available method listed, and in a consistent
  manner. Some commentary and high level examples (such as this file) are
  still maintained as dedicated markdown files, but included in the YARD
  docs, instead of being a separate site that then links to the YARD docs.
- The testing philosophy has also changed. The
  [rspec-openhab-scripting gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-openhab-scripting),
  previously written as an independent project by
  [@ccutrer](https://github.com/ccutrer), has now been merged into this gem.
  There is a tight interdependence between the two, and especially during the
  large refactoring it's much easier to have them in the same repository. This
  means that that gem is now the endorsed method to write tests for end-user
  rules, as well as the preferred way to write tests for this gem itself, when
  possible.
- Major re-organization of class structures. {OpenHAB::Core} now contains any
  classes that are mostly wrappers or extensions of org.openhab.core Java
  classes, while {OpenHAB::DSL} contains novel Ruby-only classes that implement
  a Ruby-first manner of creating rules, items, and things.
- As part of the re-organization from above, the definition of a "DSL method"
  that is publicly exposed and available for use has been greatly refined.
  Top-level DSL methods are only available on `main` (the top-level {Object}
  instance when you're writing code in a rules file and not in any other
  classes), and inside of other select additional DSL constructs. If you've
  written your own classes that need access to DSL methods, you either need
  to explicitly call them on {OpenHAB::DSL}, or mix that module into your
  class yourself. Additional internal and Java constants and methods should
  no longer be leaking out of the gem's public API.

### Breaking Changes

- Dropping support for openHAB < 3.4.
- The main require is now `require "openhab/dsl"` instead of just
  `require "openhab"`. The reason being to avoid conflicts if a gem gets
  written to access openHAB via REST API. It's probably preferred that you
  [configure automatic requires](USAGE.md#configuration) for this file anyway.
- {GenericItem} and descendants can no longer be treated as the item's state.
  While convenient at times, it introduces many ambiguities on if the intention
  is to interact with the item or its state, and contortionist code attempting
  to support both use cases.
- {OpenHAB::Core::Types::Type Enum types} no longer have implicit conversions for comparisons.
  This means you can no longer do `DimmerItem.state == ON`.
  Predicate methods retain the implicit conversion semantics, so you _can_ do `DimmerItem.on?`.
  `ensure.on`, etc. also still retain their internal implicit comparisons, so you can also still do `DimmerItem.ensure.on` and it will _not_ send {ON} if the item is anything but `0`.
  {OpenHAB::Core::Events::ItemStateEvent} and {OpenHAB::Core::Events::ItemStateChangedEvent} both now have a full set of predicate methods to ease use from within rule execution blocks.
- Semi-related to the above two points, the `#truthy?` method has been removed from any items the previously implemented it.
  Instead, be more explicit on what you mean - for example `Item.on?`.
  If you would like to use a similar structure with {StringItem StringItems}, just [include the ActiveSupport gem](USAGE.md#gems) in your rules to get `#blank?` and `#present?` methods, and then you can use `Item.state.present?`.
- Semi-related to the above, the
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#only_if only_if} and
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#not_if not_if} guards now _only_ take blocks.
  This just means where you previously had `only_if Item` you now write
  `only_if { Item.on? }`.
- Related to the above, {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#changed changed for:}
  guards no longer take items. This just means if you previously had
  `changed Item, for: OtherItem` you now write
  `changed Item, for: -> { OtherItem.state }`.
- {QuantityType} is no longer implicitly
  convertible and comparable against Strings. Use the `|` operator for easy
  construction of {QuantityType}s: `10 | "°F"`.
- {HSBType} is no longer convertible and comparable against Strings, Hashes,
  and Arrays. Just construct an HSBType. Sending a HTML hex color as a string
  as a command is still supported.
- {PointType} is no longer convertible and comparable against Strings and
  Hashes. Just construct a PointType. Send strings as a command is still supported.
- {QuantityType} can no longer be compared against `Numeric` or {DecimalType} outside
  a {OpenHAB::DSL.unit unit} block. Either compare it against another QuantityType, or
  convert it with to_f first, perform the comparison inside a
  {OpenHAB::DSL.unit unit} block, or {OpenHAB::DSL.unit! permanently set} your
  preferred units.
- The top-level `groups` method providing access to only {GroupItem}s has been
  removed. Use `items.grep(GroupItem)` if you would like to filter to only
  groups.
- `GenericItem#id` no longer exists; just use
  {Item#to_s Item#to_s} which does what `#id` used to do.
- `states?(*items)` helper is gone. Just use `items.all?(:state?)`, or in
  the rare cased you used `states?(*items, things: true)`, use
  `items.all? { |i| i.state? && i.things.all?(&:online?) }`.
- {GroupItem} is no longer {Enumerable}, and you must use
  {GroupItem#members GroupItem#members}.
- {GroupItem#all_members GroupItem#all_members} no
  longer has a `filter` parameter; use `grep` if you want just {GroupItem}s.
- `create_timer` no longer exists as an alias for {after}.
- `Item#meta` is no longer a supported alias for
  {Item#metadata Item#metadata}.
- Triggers (such as {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#changed changed},
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#updated updated}, and
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#received_command received_command} that
  previously took a splat _or_ an Array of Items now _only_ take a splat.
  This just means instead of `changed [Item1, Item2]` you write
  `changed Item1, Item2`, or if you have an actual array you write
  `changed(*item_array)`. This greatly simplifies the internal code that has to
  distinguish between {GroupItem::Members GroupItem::Members} and other
  types of collections of items.
- Date and time objects have been reworked:
  - `TimeOfDay` has been replaced with {LocalTime}
  - Date/time objects are no longer comparable to strings.
    Please use the correct type.
  - Comparisons among the varying date/time classes all work.
  - See also [Working With Time](USAGE.md#time)
  - Persistence methods no longer accept a {Duration}. Please use `Duration#ago`
    instead.
- Thing actions are no longer available as a top level method. You must use the
  {OpenHAB::Core::Things::Thing#actions Thing} object.
- Thing actions whose scope does _not_ match the thing's binding are no longer
  directly available on {OpenHAB::Core::Things::Thing Thing}; you must
  explicitly access them via
  {OpenHAB::Core::Things::Thing#actions Thing#actions}.
- {OpenHAB::Core::Items::Persistence Persistence} predicates are no longer
  aliased without the `?` (i.e. you must call `#changed_since?`, not
  `#changed_since`).
- Timers with IDs are no longer uniqueified by where they were created. Make
  sure you're using a completely unique timer ID if you're using them in
  multiple locations. For example,
  `after(1.minute, id: [:this_logical_usage, event.item])`. This makes it
  possible to schedule the same logically re-entrant timer from multiple rules.
- `OpenHAB.conf_root` was renamed to {OpenHAB::Core.config_folder}.
- {OpenHAB::Core::Items::GenericItem#metadata Metadata} now defaults to using transient backing provider.
  This means that if you add metadata to an item from Ruby, it will disappear when the script is unloaded.
  See {OpenHAB::DSL.provider} for how to revert to the old behavior within a single block, or for your entire script.
- {OpenHAB::Core::Items::GenericItem#metadata Metadata} will now be serialized before being set.
  This fixes a complicated issue where types would changed unexpectedly, or even worse, reference Ruby classes that are not even available in the current JRuby instance.
  See <https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/issues/3169> for more details.
- `#on_start` trigger was renamed to {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#on_load #on_load} and its 'run_on_start' parameter removed.
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#on_start #on_start} is now a trigger for `core.SystemStartlevelTrigger`.
- `say`, `play_sound`, and `play_stream` are no longer available at the top level.
  You must access them from their Action class: {OpenHAB::Core::Actions::Voice.say Voice.say},
  {OpenHAB::Core::Actions::Audio.play_sound Audio.play_sound}, and {OpenHAB::Core::Actions::Audio.play_stream Audio.play_stream}

### Features

- {OpenHAB::DSL::Items::Builder}
- {OpenHAB::DSL::Things::Builder}
- {group::OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL::Triggers Several new triggers}
- {OpenHAB::DSL.profile}
- {OpenHAB::DSL.script}
- {OpenHAB::DSL.shared_cache}
- {OpenHAB::Core::Rules::Registry}, specifically {OpenHAB::Core::Rules::Registry#remove #remove} and {OpenHAB::Core::Rules::Rule#trigger #trigger} are new functionality.
- {OpenHAB::DSL.unit} can now handle units for multiple dimensions.
- Support Ruby's method name convention for thing actions, e.g. `things["mqtt:broker:mosquitto"].publish_mqtt`
- {OpenHAB::DSL.timers timers} now returns {OpenHAB::DSL::TimerManager an object}
  that can be used to thread-safely schedule/reschedule/cancel timers by ID.
- `#inspect` on several classes has been improved to be useful, instead of just returning the class name.
- {OpenHAB::DSL.after after} (and anything else that ultimately relies on timers) support `Proc` for durations.
- Add `#ago` and `#from_now` methods to {Duration}.
- The ability to designate how metadata should be persisted or not, via {OpenHAB::DSL.provider}.
- {java.util.Map} and {java.util.List} now more fully implement the expected interfaces of `Hash` and `Array`, so you don't need to explicitly convert (as much) anymore.
- If you reference an item that does not currently exist in a rule trigger, instead of raising `MethodMissing` or `NameError`, the trigger will be created anyway.
  openHAB will log a warning that the item is missing, and the trigger will not work. When the item is eventually created, the trigger will begin to work.
  This matches the behavior of DSL rules.
  Note that this only works for {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::Terse terse rules} if they're created within a {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::Builder rules.build} block.
- {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#on_start #on_start} supports creating a `core.SystemStartlevelTrigger`.
  Also see {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#on_load #on_load}.

- Various Ephemeris methods on {ZonedDateTime}.
- {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#dependencies} Rule dependencies
- A set of debounce/throttle guards for file-based rules: {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#debounce_for debounce_for}, {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#throttle_for throttle_for}, and {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL#only_every only_every}
- And for UI rules: {OpenHAB::DSL.debounce_for debounce_for}, {OpenHAB::DSL.throttle_for throttle_for}, {OpenHAB::DSL.only_every only_every}
- Explicitly document modifying item tags, labels and categories (where possible), and notify openHAB of the change
- {OpenHAB::Core::Events::ItemStateEvent} and {OpenHAB::Core::Events::ItemStateChangedEvent} now have full sets of predicate methods.
- {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::Terse terse rules} now have an `on_load` parameter.
- {Item#all_groups Item#all_groups}, {Enumerable#all_members}, {Enumerable#groups}, {Enumerable#all_groups}.
- {Item#formatted_state Item#formatted_state}.
- {OpenHAB::DSL.transform} now available at top-level, like Rules DSL.
- {Item#member_of? Item#member_of?}, {Item#tagged? Item#tagged?}.
- {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::BuilderDSL.watch watch} can now be used to monitor subdirectories

- {OpenHAB::DSL::Items::TimedCommand#command Timed command} thread safety issues resolved
- {OpenHAB::DSL::Items::TimedCommand#command Timed command} now resets the on_expire setting when called again
- {OpenHAB::DSL::Items::TimedCommand#command Timed command} still sends the command even the previous timed command is still pending
- {OpenHAB::DSL::Items::TimedCommand#command Timed command} works with resetting to {NULL}/{UNDEF}
- {OpenHAB::DSL::Items::TimedCommand#command Timed command} works on items with autoupdate=false
- {OpenHAB::Core::Items::Metadata} hashes are indifferent (converts symbol keys to string keys).
- Fix {OpenHAB::DSL::Items::Ensure ensure} to work with conversions-from-string that are handled by openhab-core.
- Avoid stack overflow issues when all of ActiveSupport is required.
- Don't swallow exceptions inside of `rule` blocks - just let them propagate up.
- Fix changed duration when only the `from` state is given
- Updating an item with `nil` sets it to `NULL`, not an empty string (which will be ignored by other item types).
