    #
    # Timers with an id are reentrant by id. Reentrant means that when the same id is encountered,
    # the timer is rescheduled rather than creating a second new timer. Note that the timer will
    # execute the block provided in the latest call.
    #
    # This removes the need for the usual boilerplate code to manually keep track of timer objects.
    #
    # Timers with `id` can be managed with the built-in {timers} object.
    #
    # When a timer is cancelled, it will be removed from the object.
    #
    # Be sure that your ids are unique. For example, if you're using {Item items} as your
    # ids, you either need to be sure you don't use the same item for multiple logical contexts,
    # or you need to make your id more specific, by doing something like embedding the item in
    # array with a symbol of the timer's purpose, like `[:vacancy, item]`. But also note that
    # assuming default settings, every Ruby file (for file-based rules) or UI rule gets its
    # own instance of the timers object, so you don't need to worry about collisions among
    # different files.

    # @param [java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount, #to_zoned_date_time, Proc] duration
    #   Duration after which to execute the block
    # @param [Object] id ID to associate with timer. The timer can be managed via {timers}.
    # @param [true,false] reschedule Reschedule the timer if it already exists.
    # @yield Block to execute when the timer is elapsed.
    # @yieldparam [Core::Timer] timer
    #
    # @return [Core::Timer] if `reschedule` is false, the existing timer.
    #   Otherwise the new timer.
    #
    # @example Create a simple timer
    #   after 5.seconds do
    #     logger.info("Timer Fired")
    #   end
    #
    # @example Timers delegate methods to openHAB timer objects
    #   after 1.second do |timer|
    #     logger.info("Timer is active? #{timer.active?}")
    #   end
    #
    # @example Timers can be rescheduled to run again, waiting the original duration
    #   after 3.seconds do |timer|
    #     logger.info("Timer Fired")
    #     timer.reschedule
    #   end
    #
    # @example Timers can be rescheduled for different durations
    #   after 3.seconds do |timer|
    #     logger.info("Timer Fired")
    #     timer.reschedule 5.seconds
    #   end

    #   mytimer = after 1.minute do
    #     logger.info("It has been 1 minute")
    #   end
    #
    #   mytimer.cancel

    #   rule "Turn off closet light after 10 minutes" do
    #     changed ClosetLights.members, to: ON
    #     triggered do |item|

    #         item.ensure.off

    # @example Timers with id can be managed through the built-in `timers` object
    #   after 1.minute, id: :foo do
    #     logger.info("managed timer has fired")
    #   end

    #
