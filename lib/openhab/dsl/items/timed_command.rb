      # Extensions for {Item} to implement timed commands
      #
      # All items have an implicit timer associated with them, enabling to
      # easily set an item into a specific state for a specified duration and
      # then at the expiration of that duration have the item automatically
      # change to another state. These timed commands are reentrant, meaning
      # if the same timed command is triggered while an outstanding timed
      # command exist, that timed command will be rescheduled rather than
      # creating a distinct timed command.
      #
      # Timed commands are initiated by using the 'for:' argument with the
      # command. This is available on both the 'command' method and any
      # command-specific methods, e.g. {SwitchItem#on}.
      #
      # The timer will be cancelled, and the item's state will not be changed
      # to the on_expire state if:
      # - The item receives any command within the timed command duration.
      # - The item is updated to a different state, even if it is then updated
      #   back to the same state.
      #
      # For example, if you have a Switch on a timer and another rule sends
      # a command to that item, even when it's commanded to the same state,
      # the timer will be automatically canceled.
      #
      # Sending a different duration (for:) value for the timed
      # command will reschedule the timed command for that new duration.
      #
      module TimedCommand
        #
        # Provides information about why the expiration block of a
        # {TimedCommand#command timed command} is being called.
