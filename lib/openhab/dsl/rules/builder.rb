        # @!group Guards
        #   Guards exist to only permit rules to run if certain conditions are
        #   satisfied. Think of these as declarative `if` statements that keep
        #   the run block free of conditional logic, although you can of course
        #   still use conditional logic in run blocks if you prefer.
        #
        #   ### Guard Combination
        #
        #   Multiple guards can be used on the same rule. All must be satisfied
        #   for a rule to execute.
        #
        #   @example
        #     rule "Set OutsideDimmer to 50% if LightSwitch turned on and OtherSwitch is OFF and Door is CLOSED" do
        #       changed LightSwitch, to: ON
        #       run { OutsideDimmer << 50 }
        #       only_if { Door.closed? }
        #       not_if { OtherSwitch.on? }
        #     end

        # @!method between(range)
        #
        # Only execute rule if the current time is between the supplied time ranges.

        #   ### Trigger Attachments
        #
        #   All triggers support event attachments that enable the association
        #   of an object to a trigger. This enables one to use the same rule
        #   and take different actions if the trigger is different. The
        #   attached object is passed to the execution block through the
        #   {Core::Events::AbstractEvent#attachment} accessor.
        #
        #   @note The trigger attachment feature is not available for UI rules.
        #
        #   @example
        #     rule 'Set Dark switch at sunrise and sunset' do
        #       channel 'astro:sun:home:rise#event', attach: OFF
        #       channel 'astro:sun:home:set#event', attach: ON
        #       run { |event| Dark << event.attachment }
        #     end

        #
        # Creates a channel trigger
        #
        # The channel trigger executes rule when a specific channel is triggered. The syntax
        # supports one or more channels with one or more triggers. `thing` is an optional
        # parameter that makes it easier to set triggers on multiple channels on the same thing.
        #
        # The `event` passed to run blocks will be a {Core::Events::ChannelTriggeredEvent}.
        #
        # @param [String, Core::Things::Channel, Core::Things::ChannelUID] channels
        #   channels to create triggers for in form of 'binding_id:type_id:thing_id#channel_id'
        #   or 'channel_id' if thing is provided.
        # @param [String, Core::Things::Thing, Core::Things::ThingUID] thing
        #   Thing(s) to create trigger for if not specified with the channel.
        # @param [String, Array<String>] triggered
        #   Only execute rule if the event on the channel matches this/these event/events.
        # @param [Object] attach object to be attached to the trigger
        # @return [void]
        #
        # @example
