        #
        #   ### Trigger Attachments
        #
        #   All triggers support event attachments that enable the association
        #   of an object to a trigger. This enables one to use the same rule
        #   and take different actions if the trigger is different. The
        #   attached object is passed to the execution block through the
        #   {Core::Events::AbstractEvent#attachment} accessor.
        #
        #   @note The trigger attachment feature is not available for UI rules.
        #
        #   @example
        #     rule 'Set Dark switch at sunrise and sunset' do
        #       channel 'astro:sun:home:rise#event', attach: OFF
        #       channel 'astro:sun:home:set#event', attach: ON
        #       run { |event| Dark << event.attachment }
        #     end

        #
        # Creates a channel trigger
        #
        # The channel trigger executes rule when a specific channel is triggered. The syntax
        # supports one or more channels with one or more triggers. `thing` is an optional
        # parameter that makes it easier to set triggers on multiple channels on the same thing.
        #
        # @param [String, Core::Things::Channel, Core::Things::ChannelUID] channels
        #   channels to create triggers for in form of 'binding_id:type_id:thing_id#channel_id'
        #   or 'channel_id' if thing is provided.
        # @param [String, Core::Things::Thing, Core::Things::ThingUID] thing
        #   Thing(s) to create trigger for if not specified with the channel.
        # @param [String, Array<String>] triggered
        #   Only execute rule if the event on the channel matches this/these event/events.
        # @param [Object] attach object to be attached to the trigger

        # and `to` values will accept symbols and strings, where the symbol'
        # matches the
        # [supported status](https://www.openhab.org/docs/concepts/things.html#thing-status).
        #
        # The `event` passed to run blocks will be an
        # {Core::Events::ItemStateChangedEvent} or a
        # {Core::Events::ThingStatusInfoChangedEvent} depending on if the
        # triggering element was an item or a thing.
        #
        # @param [Item, GroupItem::Members, Thing] items Objects to create trigger for.
        # @param [State, Array<State>, #===, nil] from
        #   Only execute rule if previous state matches `from` state(s).
        # @param [State, Array<State>, #===, nil] to State(s) for

        #   Duration item must remain in the same state before executing the execution blocks.
        # @param [Object] attach object to be attached to the trigger
        # @return [void]
        #
        # @example Multiple items can be separated with a comma:
        #   rule "Execute rule when either sensor changed" do
        #     changed FrontMotion_Sensor, RearMotion_Sensor
        #     run { |event| logger.info("Motion detected by #{event.item.name}") }

        #
        #   rule "Execute rule when item is changed for specified duration" do

        #     run { logger.info("Alarm Mode Updated") }

        # @example You can optionally provide `from` and `to` states to restrict the cases in which the rule executes:
        #   rule "Execute rule when item is changed to specific number, from specific number, for specified duration" do
        #     changed Alarm_Mode, from: 8, to: [14,12], for: 12.seconds
        #     run { logger.info("Alarm Mode Updated") }
        #   end
        #
        # @example Works with ranges:
        #   rule "Execute when item changed to a range of numbers, from a range of numbers, for specified duration" do
        #     changed Alarm_Mode, from: 8..10, to: 12..14, for: 12.seconds
        #     run { logger.info("Alarm Mode Updated") }
        #   end
        #
        # @example Works with endless ranges:
        #   rule "Execute rule when item is changed to any number greater than 12"
        #     changed Alarm_Mode, to: (12..)   # Parenthesis required for endless ranges
        #     run { logger.info("Alarm Mode Updated") }
        #   end
        #
        # @example Works with procs:
        #   rule "Execute when item state is changed from an odd number, to an even number, for specified duration" do
        #     changed Alarm_Mode, from: proc { |from| from.odd? }, to: proc {|to| to.even? }, for: 12.seconds
        #     run { logger.info("Alarm Mode Updated") }
        #   end
        #
        # @example Works with lambdas:
        #   rule "Execute when item state is changed from an odd number, to an even number, for specified duration" do
        #     changed Alarm_Mode, from: -> from { from.odd? }, to: -> to { to.even? }, for: 12.seconds
        #     run { logger.info("Alarm Mode Updated") }
        #   end
        #
        # @example Works with regexes:
        #   rule "Execute when item state is changed to something matching a regex" do
        #     changed Alarm_Mode, to: /armed/
        #     run { logger.info("Alarm armed") }

        #     run { |event| logger.info("Thing #{event.uid} status <trigger> to #{event.status}") }

        #   rule "Log (or notify) when an exterior door is left open for more than 5 minutes" do

        # to watch, the parent directory will be watched and the file or
        # non-existent part of the supplied path will become the glob. For

        # `/tmp/foo/*bar`, the parent directory will be watched and the last
